    <!-- NOTE:The Chrome browser is indeed sketchy when we use functions like prompt() and alert() in the code. A workaround is to enclose the while loop with a  setTimeout() so it starts to run only after the HTML file was already rendered, but using another browser is also a great approach. -->

    Why? Want to load html prior to running js on the element -->
